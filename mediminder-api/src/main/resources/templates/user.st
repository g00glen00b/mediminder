{medicationsJson}
-----------------

The JSON is structured as follows:

* `$.name`: Name of medication known to the patient.
* `$.medicationType`: The type of medication (e.g. capsule, tablet, injection, ...)
* `$.administrationType`: The way the medication is administered (e.g. oral, topical, ...)
* `$.color`: The color the patient associates with the medication.
* `$.schedules[]`: A list of schedules for the medication. If this list is empty, the patient does not have a regular schedule for this medication (e.g. painkillers that are taken occasionally)
* `$.schedules[].when`: The time, duration and dosage of when the patient takes the medication. This is written in a human-readable format. If no end date is given, the patient is expected to take the medication indefinitely.
* `$.schedules[].description`: An additional description of how to apply the medication (e.g. before breakfast, which side to inject, ...)
* `$.cabinetEntries[]`: A list of cabinet entries for the medication. This is a list of all the packages of the medication that the patient has at home.
* `$.cabinetEntries[].remainingDoses`: The number of doses remaining in the package (e.g. "2 tablet(s)")
* `$.cabinetEntries[].expirationDate`: The expiration date of the package in a human readable form (e.g. "January 5th, 2025")
* `$.intakesToday[]`: A list of when the patient is required to take the medication today. You do not have access to the intakes of the past. So if the patient asks about whether they took their medication yesterday, you are unable to answer
* `$.intakesToday[].targetTime`: The time at which the patient intended to take the medication.
* `$.intakesToday[].completedTime`: The time at which the patient actually took the medication. If empty, the patient did not yet take the medication.
